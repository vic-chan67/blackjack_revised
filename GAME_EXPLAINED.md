## Introduction

Blackjack is a betting game where the player is only playing against the dealer and not other players. To play the player must make a bet.

## Game summarised

Blackjack is a card game played against the dealer. The objective is to bet money and have the highest scoring hand without going above 21.
If the dealer or player’s hand is above 21, that hand is a _bust_ and they lose.

Each number card is worth its number. Examples: _2 of Diamonds_ is worth 2 and _10 of Clubs_ is worth 10.
Each face card (_Kings_, _Queens_, _Jacks_) is worth 10.

_Aces_ are worth either 1 or 11. The Ace is worth 11 in the case where the total hand is less than or equal to 21. If an Ace worth 11 causes the hand to _bust_, then the Ace is worth 1.

## Game explained
The dealer places two cards face up in front of the player, then one card face up and the next face down in front of the dealer themself. 
The player chooses how much money they would like to bet. After a bet has been chosen, the dealer reveals the face down card. 

### Possible results without any action made by the player

If the dealer’s hand is 21 then the game automatically ends and the player loses their bet.
If the player’s hand is 21 then the game automatically ends and the player wins.

### Other results when neither hand is 21

The player is given a choice to hit or stand.
A _hit_ means the player wants another card which the dealer will give them.
A _stand_ means the player does not want another card.
Players can _hit_ as many times as they like, until they choose to _stand_ or their hand is a _bust_.

If a player’s hand is a _bust_ then they automatically lose and the dealer does not have to _hit_ or _stand_.
If the player hand is not a _bust_ and they have chosen to _stand_, the dealer will either _hit_ or _stand_.

If the dealer hand is a _bust_, the player automatically wins.
If the dealer hand is not a _bust_ and they have chosen to _stand_, the highest scoring hand wins.
If the hands are the same score, it is a tie.

### Bet payout

If a player has won by means of _hit_ and _stand_, the payout is 1:1.
__Example__: A player bets £50 and wins. The dealer gives them £50 and the player takes back a total of £100 (original £50 + the payout £50)

If the player won outright without having to _hit_ or _stand_ (the original two cards dealt score 21, also known as Blackjack), the payout is 3:2 or 1.5:1.
__Example__: A player bets £50 and wins with Blackjack. The dealer gives them £75 (£50 + half of £50) and the player takes back a total of £125 (original £50 + the payout £75).
