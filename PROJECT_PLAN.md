## Introduction

This project is a revised version of my [first attempt](https://github.com/vic-chan67/blackjack "Blackjack repository") at creating a game of Blackjack in C++. The first attempt did not include the game feature of the _Ace_ automatically changing its score between 11 and 1. Instead it had the player choose how much they wanted the _Ace_ to be worth when it was dealt to them and the score stayed the same throughout the turn.
